## Releasing
To release a new version of Ziglite:

- Update the version string in [PackageService](src/Services/PackageService.php#22)
- Update the package version field using [yarn version ](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/version)
- Update the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) (following the [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format)
- Rebuild the assets `yarn run build`
- Commit and push the changes to the appropriate branch.
- Publish a new release on Github
    - Make sure you create a tag targetting the right branch
    - Make sure the name is the correct version prefixed with `v`

The [npm.yaml](.github/workflows/npm.yaml) workflow will then be triggered to publish the NPM package.

Use an appropriate suffix (i.e. `-beta` in the branch name and version) and mark the GitHub release as a pre-release when creating a beta, RC, or pre-release.\
This will publish the NPM package unde the `next` tag.
